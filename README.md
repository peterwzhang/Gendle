# Gendle

A guessing game similar to Wordle, but you try to guess Genshin Impact Characters based on their attributes instead of words. This project was inspired by [LoLdle](https://loldle.net/) and uses the [genshin.dev API](https://github.com/genshindev/api) to get character data.

**You can try it [here](https://peterwzhang.github.io/Gendle/)!**

## Setup

You can follow these steps to run this project locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. `$ cd Gendle`
3. `$ npm install`
4. `$ npm start`

## Future additions

Here are some things I would like to add/fix in the future:

1. Create a MUI theme to help keep the colors and stylings consistent
2. Make the game responsive so it can be easily played on mobile
3. Add animations 
4. Instructions
5. Options - dark mode, language, etc
6. Find a better way to fit text in the property boxes
7. Other game modes such as guessing items or different ways to guess (maybe)
